🚀 Updated Final Instructions
Once you paste that code, follow these steps to finish the deployment:

Commit Changes: Click the green "Commit changes..." button at the top right of your GitHub screen to save the file.

Verify Root Files: Ensure your main repository folder also has these two files:

app.py: The Python script for your map.

requirements.txt: The list of libraries (streamlit, pandas, folium, etc.).

Deploy on Streamlit:

Go to .

Select your openresilience repository.

Click "Deploy".

🧠 Why this code is necessary
Theme: It forces the application to use a professional "Water Blue" color scheme rather than the default "red/black" Streamlit look.

Server: It ensures the app runs smoothly in a "headless" cloud environment (without a physical monitor attached) and prevents cross-origin (CORS) errors during data fetching.
