## Overview
OpenResilience is a crisis‑signal intelligence system designed to surface environmental and market stress indicators related to drought, water scarcity, and food insecurity.

This platform is intended as:
- Decision‑support infrastructure
- Research tooling
- Coordination augmentation

It is NOT an automated decision authority.

## Mission
Reduce information asymmetry in environments where resource stress impacts human well‑being.

## Governance Alignment
This repository operates under:

- Ethics‑first engineering
- Harm minimization
- Privacy‑preserving data structures
- Transparency of assumptions

## Usage Notice
This system produces probabilistic signals — not certainties.
All outputs must be validated locally before operational use.
