# 💧 Where Is The Water? — OpenResilience Kenya

**Water & food stress intelligence for Kenya's 47 counties.**  
Built for farmers, NGOs, county governments, and community leaders.

> 🔶 **DEMO MODE** — Current data is synthetic. Indices are computed from real formulas against generated inputs. [Index methodology](docs/INDEX_METHODOLOGY.md) is documented and production data adapters are underway.

## What it does

OpenResilience surfaces four stress indices updated per monitoring cycle:

| Index | Measures | Key inputs |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **WSI** — Water Stress | Rainfall deficit + soil dryness | CHIRPS rainfall, SMAP soil moisture |
| **FSI** — Food Stress | Crop production risk | WSI + NDVI vegetation anomaly + field reports |
| **MSI** — Market Stress | Staple food price pressure | Maize price change vs seasonal average |
| **CRI** — Composite Risk | Overall household resilience risk | Weighted combination of WSI/FSI/MSI |

[→ Full index methodology, weights, and data sources](docs/INDEX_METHODOLOGY.md)

## SMS alerts reach farmers without smartphones

The platform sends **bilingual SMS alerts** (English + Kiswahili) via Africa's Talking to any mobile phone — including basic feature phones with no data plan. County coordinators subscribe farmers; alerts trigger automatically when CRI crosses Watch/Alert/Emergency thresholds.

```
[OpenResilience] Turkana Alert:
Water stress HIGH (WSI 0.74).
Plant sorghum only if rains confirmed.
Nafaka: panda mtama tu ukiwa na uhakika wa mvua.
```

## Architecture

```
app.py                          ← Streamlit UI (farmer + NGO views)
src/openresilience/             ← Core scoring, agriculture, export
  adapters/                     ← NASA IMERG, SMAP, Earth Engine connectors
api/                            ← FastAPI REST layer for programmatic access
notifier/                       ← SMS/WhatsApp alert worker
worker/                         ← Scheduled data refresh jobs
shared/or_shared/               ← Shared scoring, trust labeling, rate limiting
data/                           ← County baseline data, seed files
migrations/                     ← Database schema versioning
```

The architecture is production-ready: separate API, worker, and notifier services with Docker Compose orchestration. The current bottleneck is connecting real satellite data sources — not the infrastructure.

## Roadmap to live data

See [docs/DATA_ADAPTERS.md](docs/DATA_ADAPTERS.md) for full integration plan.

**Highest-impact next step:** CHIRPS rainfall data for one county (API is free, no signup required). One real county transforms the narrative from demo to operational pilot.

| Source | Status | Priority |
|--------|--------|----------|
| CHIRPS rainfall | Adapter written, pending activation | 🔴 High |
| NASA SMAP soil moisture | Adapter written | 🔴 High |
| NDMA field reports | Integration designed | 🟡 Medium |
| WFP price data | Planned | 🟡 Medium |
| Google Earth Engine NDVI | Adapter written | 🟢 Lower |

## Quick start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## Governance

This repository operates under strict ethics-first principles:

- 🔶 **DEMO vs REAL** — All synthetic data is clearly labelled. No demo output is presented as operational.
- 📐 **Documented methodology** — Index weights and formulas are explained and referenced ([INDEX_METHODOLOGY.md](docs/INDEX_METHODOLOGY.md)).
- 🔒 **No PII collection** — Community data is anonymised at source; no personal information is stored in demo mode.
- ⚠️ **Not a decision authority** — This is decision-support infrastructure. All outputs require local validation before operational use.
